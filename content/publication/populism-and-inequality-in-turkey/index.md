abstract: "Throughout his rule, ErdoÄŸan has relied on populist tools of rhetoric, control, and suppression of his opposition. These populist policies have included the claim to represent the real people of Turkey in their struggle against the elites; expansion of public aid to the poor, especially to AKP loyalists; increased executive power and a dismantling of the judiciary, fueled by widely false allegations of sedition against his political opponents; increased corruption despite the promises to get rid of corruption, and more. As Turkey has become more populist and authoritarian, it has also seen repeated economic failures and increases in economic and political inequality."
