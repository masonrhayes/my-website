abstract: "As an ex-Yugoslav state, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has historically had close political ties with the People’s Republic of China. Now, as one of the countries participating in China’s 16 + 1 initiative, BiH has increased its diplomatic relations with China and plans to strengthen its historically weak economic ties to China to gain access to China's growing markets. So far, however, China's main ties in BiH have been continuously linked to fraud, money laundering, and inefficient projects."
