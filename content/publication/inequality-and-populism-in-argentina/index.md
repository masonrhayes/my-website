abstract: "Argentina has experienced a more substantial increase in inequality than any other Latin American country (Acosta & Gasparini, 2007). The recent mass protests against economic and political inequality in Chile, a country that has lower levels of inequality than Argentina, further demonstrates the importance of this research and the political polarization caused by such high inequality. In this paper, I examine the relationship between economic inequality and populism in Argentina from the end of the 19th century through the latter part of the 20th century. Drawing on recent analysis by Alvaredo et al. (2018) and the Argentine Exceptionalism special collection, I  seek to showh the association between economic inequality and the rise of populist policy in Argentina throughout the 20th century."
