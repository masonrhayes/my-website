abstract: "Capital concentration and foreign ownership of capital were essential factors in the successful formation of a class alliance between the middle class and the local capitalist class through their creation of a common enemy in Argentina â€“ the oligarchy. The Radical Party could not have been successful, and indeed would probably never have been formed, if not for the growth in power of the ruling oligarch."
